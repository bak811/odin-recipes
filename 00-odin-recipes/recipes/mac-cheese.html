<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mac and cheese, short for macaroni and cheese, is a comforting and indulgent dish that features small pasta shapes, typically elbow macaroni, coated in a creamy cheese sauce. The dish often starts with a rich béchamel sauce made from butter, flour, and milk, which is then mixed with a generous amount of cheese—common choices include cheddar, mozzarella, or a blend for extra flavor.</p>
    <p>The texture is creamy and smooth, with a delightful contrast between the tender pasta and the gooey cheese. Many recipes also include a crispy breadcrumb topping, adding a satisfying crunch. Whether baked in the oven or prepared on the stovetop, mac and cheese is a beloved comfort food that can be enjoyed as a main dish or a side, often evoking feelings of nostalgia and warmth.</p>
