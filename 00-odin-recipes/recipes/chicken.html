<h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Orange chicken is a popular dish in Chinese-American cuisine, featuring bite-sized pieces of chicken that are lightly battered and fried until crispy.</p>
    <p> Tossed in a vibrant, tangy sauce made from fresh orange juice, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger, it delivers a delightful balance of sweetness and zest. Often garnished with green onions and served over a bed of fluffy rice, orange chicken is both comforting and indulgent, making it a favorite among many.</p></p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb boneless, skinless chicken (thighs or breasts), cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>1 cup orange juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>Optional: garlic or ginger for extra flavor, and green onions for garnish</li>
        </ul>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Chicken:</li>
            <ul><li>In a bowl, toss the chicken pieces with cornstarch until they are evenly coated. This will help create a crispy texture when cooked.</li></ul>
            <li>Make the Sauce:</li>
            <ul><li>In a separate bowl, mix the orange juice and soy sauce. If using garlic or ginger, you can add minced garlic or grated ginger to the sauce at this stage.</li></ul>
            <li>Cook the Chicken:</li>
            <ul><li>Heat a bit of oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the coated chicken pieces and cook until they are golden brown and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li></ul>
            <li>Combine and Simmer:</li>
            <ul><li>In the same skillet, add the orange juice and soy sauce mixture. Bring it to a simmer, allowing it to thicken slightly (about 3-5 minutes). If you want a thicker sauce, you can mix a little cornstarch with water and add it to the sauce.</li></ul>
            <li>Add the Chicken:</li>
            <ul><li>Return the cooked chicken to the skillet, tossing it in the sauce until it's well coated. Let it cook for an additional minute or two.</li></ul>
            <li>Serve:</li>
            <ul><li>Garnish with sliced green onions if desired. Serve the orange chicken over rice or with vegetables. </li></ul>
